# Explain Me That!
It is an engaging game designed to help English learners improve their vocabulary and descriptive skills. With its combination of Taboo-like gameplay and a Tinder-inspired interface, the game offers two modes: _Time Attack_ and _Card Set_.

- In _Time Attack_, players have a limited period to describe as many words as possible, putting their creativity and word choice to the test. The challenge lies in explaining the words without using certain restricted terms. The faster and more accurate your descriptions, the higher your score!
- In _Card Set_ mode, players are given a set of cards and must describe each word before time runs out. The countdown adds excitement and urgency to the gameplay. Can you successfully explain all the words in the set?

The game keeps track of your game time and score and provides statistics from your recent matches, allowing you to monitor your progress and see how you're improving over time. The game also offers a _Free Play_ training mode where you can practice without affecting your overall statistics.
